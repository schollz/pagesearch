The word is used to refer both to branching tour puzzles through which the solver must find a route, and to simpler non-branching (\"unicursal\") patterns that lead unambiguously through a convoluted layout to a goal. (The term \"labyrinth\" is generally synonymous with \"maze\", but can also connote specifically a unicursal pattern.[1]) The pathways and walls in a maze are typically fixed, but puzzles in which the walls and paths can change during the game are also categorised as mazes or tour puzzles.",
